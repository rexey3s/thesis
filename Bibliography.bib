@article{repair, 
	Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the problem of repairing unsatisfiable
	concepts in an OWL ontology in detail, keeping in mind the user
	perspective as much as possible. We focus on various aspects of the repair
	process – improving the explanation support to help the user understand
	the cause of error better, exploring various strategies to rank erroneous
	axioms (with motivating use cases for each strategy), automatically generating
	repair plans that can be customized easily, and suggesting appropriate
	axiom edits where possible to the user. Based on the techniques
	described, we present a preliminary version of an interactive ontology
	repair tool and demonstrate its applicability in practice},
